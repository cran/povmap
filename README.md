The R package povmap is designed to facilitate the production of small
area estimates of means and poverty headcount rates. It adds several new
features to the emdi package. These include new options for
incorporating survey weights, ex-post benchmarking of estimates, two
additional transformations, and several new convenient functions to
assist with reporting results.
